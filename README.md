# Project Title: Shapes and Polygon Calculations

This assignment is object oriented and has a simple task of calculating the area and length of each shape using classes and functions as well as identify what type of shape it is from according to the rules of what defines a shape as that shape.

## Limitations

There are some limitations with the program as it currently is hardcoded with set variables that cannot change and there is no way to identify more complex shapes.

* Lacks user input and visual presentation.
* Needs to be more interactive.



### Notable Comments

My thoughts, process, and any notable things I have realized in the Python language and assignment 

While coding this assignment I found it was extremely interesting to code in OOP style of coding and trying to manage the variables so the program fits and can be used later on. <br>


### Algorithm

A step by step guide that will tell you how to get started developing the program.
```
1. Create classes for any shape your trying to calculate as well as a way to identify which shape.

2. create appropriate functions in each class to calculate the area and or perimeter

3. The all the shape classes should be derived from a main class

4.Triangles must have their sides checked to see if they make a triangle indeed.

5.Rectangles can have any (positive-valued floating-point) value for length and width.

6.Pentagons and hexagons can be assumed to be regular polygons, i.e., specifying the length of one side should be enough

```


## Usage

A few examples of useful commands and/or tasks.

```
import sys             
import math      
```
