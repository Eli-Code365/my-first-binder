We noticed that this assignment was using similar data and code from the previous 5th and 4th assignments; so we decided to use the code from assignment 5 as a starting point since assignment 6 was pretty much a continuation. The beginning stages of this task were not very difficult as we already had some experience with using csv files and the csv reader. Due to the difficulty of this assignment and constantly getting stuck on issues after the “Summary Statistics” section, we all kept working pretty closely and helped with coding , documenting and design. By doing this we were able to do better research and save much more time.\n\n## Summary Statistics:\nFor this part of the assignment we split some of the workload since the task required us to do some research and find certain formulas. While certain parts of this section of the assignment were relatively simple such as writing the code for the mean and max , a certain part took us hours of research to find. We researched through the book and the web for hours in order to find a way to code the “standard deviation” for the dataset. Eventually we managed to find a way to write the formula into code without the help of a data science library.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"id":"japanese-drove","cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Module calls**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"aboriginal-fever","cell_type":"code","source":"import csv\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as pp\nimport seaborn as bb","execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"id":"medieval-office","cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Description**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"running-appearance","cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"This program reads and manipulates data_reader from the irs.csv file and 'pretty' prints the results.\")","execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis program reads and manipulates data_reader from the irs.csv file and 'pretty' prints the results.\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"id":"explicit-surgery","cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Functions**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"vietnamese-rally","cell_type":"code","source":"def flower_type(a, b): \n    petal_length = a\n    petal_width = b\n    print(\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")\n\n    if petal_length < 1:\n        print(\"No Such flower Exists\")\n    elif (petal_length >= 1 and petal_length <= 1.9) and (petal_width >= .1 and petal_width <= .6):\n        print(\"flower is setosa\")\n    elif petal_length >= 3 and petal_length <= 6.9:\n        print(\"Either versicolor or virginicia\")\n        if (petal_length >= 3 and petal_length <= 5.1) and (petal_width >= 1 and petal_width <= 1.8):\n            print(\"Flower is veriscolor: \")\n        if (petal_length >= 5.1 and petal_length <= 6.9) and (petal_width >= 1.8 and petal_width <= 2.5):\n            print(\"is virgincia:\")\n    print(\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")","execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"concrete-heating","cell_type":"code","source":"def avg(A):\n    return sum(A) / len(A)","execution_count":4,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"prostate-panama","cell_type":"code","source":"def minimum(B):\n    minimum_value = min(B)\n    return minimum_value","execution_count":5,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"liable-animal","cell_type":"code","source":"def maximun(C):\n    maximum_value = max(C)\n    return maximum_value","execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"id":"assigned-newport","cell_type":"code","source":"def standard_deviation(D):\n    sum_atr = 0\n    for i in range(len(D)):\n        sum_atr += D[i]\n    mean_atr = sum_atr/len(D)\n    #
